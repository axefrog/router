# @motorcycle/router

A router driver built on-top of @motorcycle/history

This driver builds on top of @motorcycle/history to create a router.
`makeRouterDriver(history)` expects the same type of history object as @motorcycle/history.
The input (sink returned by main()) to the driver is the same as that supported by @motorcycle/history.
However the output (source injected to main()) is very different.
See the [API documentation](https://motorcyclejs.github.io/router/docs) for more information.
